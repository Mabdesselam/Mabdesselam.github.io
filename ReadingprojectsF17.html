Proposed reading projects.

<HR COLOR="#003366">


<p>
<h3>Project 1:</h3>
There is an analogue of spherical coordinates for integration over matrices. This relates to the vast and active area known as random matrix theory.
As an introduction to this subject, I propose for this project to read the article
by A. Zvonkin,
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895717797002100">Matrix integrals and map enumeration: an accessible introduction</a>.
Combinatorics and physics (Marseilles, 1995).
Math. Comput. Modelling 26 (1997), no. 8-10, 281-304. 

<p>
<h3>Project 2:</h3>
Read the article by Cohn and Elkies, <a href="http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2003/157-2/p09">New upper bounds on sphere packings. I</a>.
Ann. of Math. (2) 157 (2003), no. 2, 689-714. This relates the theory of Fourier transforms of functions in Schwartz space S to optimal sphere packings.
We will soon cover Fourier analysis but you can already look up Section 8.3 of Folland to get started.

<p>
<h3>Project 3:</h3>
Read the article by S. Mallat, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2001373">Multiresolution approximations and wavelet orthonormal bases of L2(R)</a>.
Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 315 (1989), no. 1, 69-87. It is about wavelets and Fourier analysis.
<br>
<b>Sold! to Mark</b>.

<p>
<h3>Project 4:</h3>
For an introduction to quantum field theory from the operator theory angle read Section IX.8 "The G&aring;rding-Wightman axioms" (with its appendix) and
Section X.7 "Free quantum fields", from volume 2 of the book by Reed and Simon <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Kz7s7bgVe8gC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false">"Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics" </a>(1975 edition).
This needs some knowledge of spectral theory.
<br>
<b>Sold! to Kristin</b>.


<p>
<h3>Project 5:</h3>
About combinatorics and the "game of centipedes", read the first few chapters of the book by Grace and Young <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PhoPAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false">"The Algebra of Invariants"</a>. I would have to give some one-on-one explanations to relate it to the diagrammatic language. It is very elementary but goes into very deep mathematics.

<p>
<h3>Project 6:</h3>
We will soon see in the present Section 2.2 of the course, the spaces D and s_0 tensor s. An important theorem due to Valdivia and Vogt says that these two topological vector spaces are isomorphic. This project asks to read the nice explicit proof given by Bargetz, 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X14011184?via%3Dihub">Explicit representations of spaces of smooth functions and distributions</a>.
J. Math. Anal. Appl. 424 (2015), no. 2, 1491-1505. 


<p>
<h3>Project 7:</h3>
A generalization of the method for solving the Poisson Equation is provided by the Malgrange-Ehrenpreis Theorem.
This project asks to read the nice article about this result by Ortner and Wagner, 
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.41.3661">A short proof of the Malgrange-Ehrenpreis theorem</a>. 
Functional analysis (Trier, 1994), 343-352, de Gruyter, Berlin, 1996. 
<br>
<b>Sold! to Sarasij</b>.

<p>
<h3>Project 8:</h3>
Related to number theory and Tate's Thesis, read Chapter 2 from the <a href="https://libra2.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/2r36tx772">Ph.D. thesis of Ajay Chandra</a>.
This gives a classification of homogeneous rotation invariant distributions over the reals and the p-adics. Integrating against suitable test functions and taking the product over places, gives L-functions or zeta functions.
<br>
<b>Sold! to Stephen</b>.

<p>
<h3>Project 9:</h3>
Regarding Littlewood-Paley theory and Besov spaces, read the article by 
Gubinelli,  Imkeller and Perkowski,
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/forum-of-mathematics-pi/article/paracontrolled-distributions-and-singular-pdes/6CCE38808509AB7E66434C64E7CADDC1">Paracontrolled distributions and singular PDEs</a>.
Forum Math. Pi 3 (2015), e6, 75 pp. (Read what you can starting from Appendix A)

<p>
<h3>Project 10:</h3>
Related to the previous project, read the article by Hairer, <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bjps/1429105588">Introduction to regularity structures</a>.
 Braz. J. Probab. Stat. 29 (2015), no. 2, 175-210.  <a href="http://personal-homepages.mis.mpg.de/diehl/lecture.pdf">These notes</a> by Joscha Diehl can also help.
<br>
<b>Sold! to Liaosha</b>.

<p>
<h3>Project 11:</h3>
Regarding differential operators, read the proof of Peetre's Theorem given by Paul Garrett in the note <a href="http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~garrett/m/v/peetre.pdf">"Characterization of differential operators"</a>.

by Audrey Terras <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-B2TA669dJMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false">"Fourier Analysis on finite Groups and Applications"</a>.
<br>
<b>Sold! to Mojdeh (Diaconis book)</b>.
Someone can still do the Terras book but would have to go quite far since it is a very easy read.

<p>
<h3>Project 16:</h3>
A more ambitious version of Project 3, read the article by Daubechies, <a href="http://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/svn/bibli/local/Daubechies1988Orthonormal.pdf">Orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets</a>.  Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 41 (1988), no. 7, 909-996.
